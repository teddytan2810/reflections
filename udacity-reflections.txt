Git and Git hub - lessons from udacity.


1. use simple text editor eg. notepad so that we can easily look at file contents on the command line.
2. The course uses sublime

3. version controls , dropbox, google drive, wikipedia etc provide version control.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in git vs having versions automatically saved, like google docs does/

Manual save is more efficent in keeping different versions of the file, however may be risk data lost if the author do not commit frequently.

Why do you think some version control systems, like GIT, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while other, like google docs treat each file separately?

eg.. there are files that are related and to commit all files ensure that all files are saved.
